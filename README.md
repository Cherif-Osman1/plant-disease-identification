# plant-disease-identification
this is a machine learning project made possible by finetuning the effecientnetB0 (pretrained cnn model) model to detect the plant diseases from a picture of its leaf.

this is my first ever machine learning and image classification project, it was done with the help of chaich abderaouf and hocine elyes wassim

the problems with the project right now are :
- there is no variation in the data set, so if you want an accurate prediction you must take a picture similar the ones in the data set or else youl get a false prediction
- there are better models than efficientnetb0 in terms of accuracy and computational requirements
- the training it self could be improved by maybe adding other special augmentaion or cnn blocks
